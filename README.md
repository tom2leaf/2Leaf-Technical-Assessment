# README #

Hello! If you're reading this, it means that you have moved on to the nest step of your coding interview with 2Leaf web development. 
For this assessment, you will be asked to code a simple html landing page based on one of our designs.
You will be provided with the following:

* This repository, which includes a blank html, css, and javascript file where you will write your code. 
* A design file using Figma, an online web development software we us for designs
* [Figma File](https://www.figma.com/file/5l22ti4pFgFKSnlA93ouM7/branch/bWXSVeZJBLDgog0ysvTWGT/LevelUp?node-id=22%3A2)
* An assets folder containing all of the images that are used in the design file, for your convenience. 

### How do I get set up? ###

* Clone this repository to your local environment
* Follow the guidelines to the best of your abilities
* Upload to a personal github/bitbucket portfolio, and share that link with us
* Bonus point if you would like to deploy it using something like Github Pages, although entirely unnecessary


### Guidelines ###

* Your primary objective is to code the landing page provided in this figma link.
* You should have all of the required assets you need for this project other than the font files, which have been purposely excluded but can be found [here](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans) and [here](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Alfa+Slab+One)
* Also included in the assets folder is a minified copy of jQuery, which will be the only additional library you should use for this website. 
* Please refrain from using styling libraries like bootstrap or tailwind, although if you feel them necessary to include, we'd rather see that than nothing.
* You will have 1 week to complete this assessment, but time to complete will be a factor in our consideration as well.


### Instructions ###

* Code only the landing page (the one with the two children playing basketball in the header)
* Make it so that the header slides right every 5 seconds to reveal the alternate header (the picture of the children on the beach)
* Create a modal popup that stickies to the center of the screen, prompting users to submit a password
* The modal should be toggleable by clicking outside of the modal, or in the X in the top left corner
* The modal popup should be capable of making a post request to the base url + "/login", and the contact form should be capable of posting to the base url + "/signup"
* The page should also be mobile responsive to look appropriate on a tablet and a phone screen
